 Fall 2021, I accidentally signed up for research credits in the physical sciences but with the incorrect professors.  
 I was notified of the error by My (December 2021) . I didnâ€™t realize the mistake untill the quarter had ended.  
When I contacted the registrar's office they informed me that fixing the situation would be a 2 step process.
Step 1 would be to have the proffesors do post quarter drops for me, step 2 would be to then have the correct proffesors do post-quarter
add. 


 I reached out to both proffesors and believed that would resolve the situation them and that I was able to drop out
 of the courses (Feb 2022).  The drops were never processed, and I realize until I was asked to pay back tuition for that quarter, 
since my grade for Fall 2021 were U/F, since I never worked for those proffesors.

I have since then with the help of the department contacted all channels and fixed the issue, however, 
I didnt meet the registration deadline.


* Explain why I didnt resolve issue super quickly, contacting counselor, options, leave of abcesnce




* call registrar,see what charge is for


* did issue fix?
