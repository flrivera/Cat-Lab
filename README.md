# Pet-Lab:
###  Flower Classification and Toxicity Information App
   
## Overview

This app leverages a classification model created using ImageNet and transfer learning.  For model information look at the github pages, for the model itself e-mail me at flrivera@uci.edu.

Pet-Lab is an innovative application designed to help pet owners keep their pets safe. By simply uploading a picture of a flower, users can obtain toxicity levels with just a click of a button. The app identifies flowers based on unique characteristics, categorizing them into five types. It then searches a database to provide users with toxicity information, including severity and common symptoms, as well as a flower description to aid in detection confirmation.

## Installation
Available through Streamlit.

Clone repo and use ‘streamlit run Recog_app.py’



## Project Structure
- **Recog_app_AWS_call.py**: uses s3fs to both save and retrieve ml models as zip files. Taken from https://gist.github.com/ramdesh keras_model_s3_wrapper.py
- **remove_image_background**: Contains functions for background removal using OpenCV. Python function that takes an image file path as input, removes the background of the image, and saves the resulting image with a transparent background. It utilizes the OpenCV library to perform image processing operations.
- **decode_and_resize.py**: Implements image decoding and resizing operations.
-	**toxicity.py**:  handles the web scrapping for pet toxicity info of classified flowers using https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants
- **Recog_app.py**: The main application file that integrates the functionalities from other files.

## Usage


1.	Upload a picture using the Pet-Lab app.
2.	Using Classification Model saved from AWS classify the flower in the picture
3.	Click the button to obtain toxicity levels.
4.	Receive information about the identified flower, including toxicity severity and common symptoms.
