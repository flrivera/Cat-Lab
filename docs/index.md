### Approximately 67% of households have pets in the United States, yet toxicity levels of common flowers are not readily available. 

Pet-Lab will:
- Use a nueral network to identify the flower.
- Search database to provide user with toxicity information (severity, common symptoms) as well as flower description to aide in detection confirmation.

APCC by the ASPCA does have information about the toxicity of plants and flowers but lacks identification capabilities. 

Some of the most common complaints about APCC are as follows:
- Poor pictures of plants/ dont know what plants I have are called
- Listings by common not latin names
- Doesnt say how much would be toxic
- The contact number to poison control charges a fee.
- Small amount of plants and hasn't been updated since 2015.
- Doesn/t have flowers commonly used in essential oils.
- “Much to exact. Recognizes almond but not almonds. Does not recognize anything    with a trailing space.
- Weeds,  You have plants but nothing about weeds which dogs are more likely to eat.
