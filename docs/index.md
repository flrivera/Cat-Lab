Pet-Lab will:
- Identify the flower type depending on unique charasteristics.
- Search database to provide user with toxicity information (severity, common symptoms) as well as flower description to aide in detection confirmation.

| -------------- |
| APCC by the ASPCA does have information about the toxicity of plants and flowers but lacks identification capabilities.   |



**Some of the most common complaints about APCC are as follows:**
- Poor pictures of plants/ dont know what plants I have are called
- Listings by common not latin names
- Doesnt say how much would be toxic
- The contact number to poison control charges a fee.
- Small amount of plants and hasn't been updated since 2015.
- Doesn/t have flowers commonly used in essential oils.
- â€œMuch to exact. Recognizes almond but not almonds. Does not recognize anything    with a trailing space.
- Weeds,  You have plants but nothing about weeds which dogs are more likely to eat.
