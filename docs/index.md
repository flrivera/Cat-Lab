## Approximately 67% of households have pets in the United States, yet toxicity levels of common flowers are not readily available. 

Pet-Lab will:
- Identify the flower type depending on unique charasteristics.
- Search database to provide user with toxicity information (severity, common symptoms) as well as flower description to aide in detection confirmation.


## Existing products and gap in the Market

| -------------- |
| APCC by the ASPCA does have information about the toxicity of plants and flowers but lacks identification capabilities.   |


## How to tell plants and flowers apart?



### Average images and PCA of the 5 most common classes (rose, dandelion, daisy, tulip, sunflower): This showcases How finding properties(features) of each image can help differentiate between the 5 classes.

### Fitting and making predictions: We will be using transfer learning as a way of generating features that differentiate our 5 unique classes

- Using an already trained convolutional neural network (Inception):
